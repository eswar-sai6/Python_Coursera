var = 20 + 22  # this is a right mathematical expression in python but if we need to print we have to put print.
print(20 + 22)
print(4 / 2)  # this gives a division of 4 and 2 with floating point value
print(5 // 2)  # truncated division for 5/2 where we can not get the remainder 1
print(9 // 5)  # it produces the 1 because it does not round to 2
print(9.0 // 5.0)  # it produces the output as 1.0 because the 9.0 and 5.0 are floating point numbers
print(9 % 5)  # This is the remainder or modulus operator

# The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For example, you can check whether one number is
# divisible by anotherâ€”if x % y is zero, then x is divisible by y. Also, you can extract the right-most digit or
# digits from a number. For example, x % 10 yields the right-most digit of x (in base 10). Similarly, x % 100 yields
# the last two digits
print(18 / 4)  # it produces a floating point value
